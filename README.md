## Codecademy Club Site project

*This site is **not** meant to be a fully working website (yet)*. 

I am going throught the Codecademy Full Stack Career Path, and this is one of the related projects in the "Bulding Responsive Websites"
section of the path. The goal was to create a responsive club page using various CSS techniques learned so far, such as flexbox and grid.

I am open to any critique about my choice of code. Feedback from other developers and learners is important to my learning and growth.

**note** As I continue to develop my code knowledge, I will make updates to the current code, and add new features.
