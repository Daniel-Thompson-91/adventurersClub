        <h2>What is National Adventurer's Club?</h2>
        <p>
          We all know how easy it is to get caught up in the daily grind. We wake up to an alarm, do our morning routine, go to work, come home, and then go to sleep only to repeat the process again. At the National Adventurer's Club, we believe that it is paramount that we find time to get away from the monotony of work life and connect with nature. That doesn't have to be limited to one activity. Do you enjoy camping? Join us for one of our overnight, or extended camping tirps. Is fishing more your thing? We have members who spend every weekend on the water. Prefer more liesurely ativities in nature? We have bird watching groups, star gazing groups, we even have groups who meet to walk in the park for a brief escape.

            Located next to Sequoia National Park, Kings Canyon Park is composed of two distinct areas - Grant Grove (home to the General Grant tree, also known as "the Nation's Christmas Tree") and Cedar Grove. Grant Grove visitors snap photos and marvel at the sheer size of the sequoia grove. Kings Canyon is also home to Redwood Canyon, the largest remaining grove of sequoia trees in the world.
